    "desc": "Our Dubbel has a deep brown-red colour. At once, this beer greets you with a sweet caramel aroma. The sweet berry, dark fruit, and slightly nutty flavours are well balanced with a subdued malt background. While pilsner malt provides the Dubbel’s base, its colour comes mostly from the addition of Belgian “candi” syrup, a traditional ingredient added for flavour complexity and alcohol content. The interaction between the candi syrup and the complex flavours produced by our house yeast strain give our Dubbel its signature taste and place it well within the Trappist tradition.",
